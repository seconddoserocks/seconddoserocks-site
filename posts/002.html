      <p>This wasn’t a coup... It was gravity. Nay, destiny.</p>

      <p>
        Momentum was building, but direction was missing, and hesitation was getting just a bit too comfortable.
        That ends now - I’m managing Second Dose... and now they know.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second Dose didn't necessarily <i>ask</i> me to manage the band - I noticed no one was in the driver's seat and hopped on in.
        Yes, I'm already busy as President of FIRA, but this band has the riffs, the energy, and $12 for a website,
        so what could possibly go wrong?!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re wondering whether this will make things more organized — yes.<br>
        If you’re wondering whether it will make things quieter — you’ve misunderstood the assignment.

      <h3>Fan Mail (Received This Morning)</h3>

      <div class="fan-mail">

        <p>
          <strong>From:</strong> <em>RiffWizard69</em><br>
          <strong>Subject:</strong> Important Band Direction Question
        </p>

        <p>Dear S.D. Overdrive,</p>

        <p>I’ve been a fan of rock music since 1994 and I feel it’s important to ask:</p>

        <p>
          Will Second Dose be switching to a triple-neck guitar setup to better honor the spiritual lineage of classic arena rock?
        </p>

        <p>Also, will there be pyro indoors?</p>

        <p>
          Lastly, do you think the band should release <em>Rise Above</em> exclusively on glow-in-the-dark vinyl
          to maximize the vibrational frequency of the riffs?
        </p>

        <p>
          Respectfully,<br>
          Todd<br>

      <h3>Response</h3>

      <p>Todd,</p>
      <p>Excellent questions. All of them.</p>

      <p>
        Triple-neck guitars are situational. You don’t deploy that kind of firepower unless the room deserves it.
        When it does, we’ll know.
      </p>

      <p>
        Indoor pyro is not a question of <em>if</em>, but insurance. We’ll cross that bridge loudly.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for glow-in-the-dark vinyl — sound is vibration, vibration is physics, and physics doesn’t lie.
        So yes. Conceptually, you’re thinking in the right direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep your amps warm and your expectations high.<br>
        More updates soon. Probably sooner.
      </p>
