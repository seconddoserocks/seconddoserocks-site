      <p>This was formally announced earlier this month, but I wanted to share it here.  It happened just as I was sliding into my current role at Second Dose Enterprises, but the gravity of this award should not be diminished by the circumstances of my ascension.</p>

      <p>
        After being President of FIRA for the past 3 years, I am pleased to now be a part of the braintrust that created this distinguished award.<br>
        Please find the original post below, and thank you for your attention to this matter:

The Federation of International Rock Advancement (FIRA) is proud to announce that Justin Hawkins has been selected as the recipient of the 2025 Second Dose Peace Prize, honoring individuals whose extraordinary contributions have promoted peace, unity, and harmonic stability across the planet.
The Second Dose Peace Prize, now in its inaugural year, recognizes rock musicians and creators who elevate global discourse through music, humor, authenticity, and the courage to hit notes most humans can only dream of.
“Justin Hawkins embodies everything this award stands for,” said S.D. Overdrive, President of FIRA. “He is a beacon of positivity, a bridge between generations of music lovers, and an unrelenting champion of the transformative power of rock. Also, nobody else submitted a falsetto capable of diffusing geopolitical tension.”
Hawkins rose to international acclaim as the frontman of The Darkness, known for his soaring vocals and flamboyant stage presence, and has since become one of YouTube’s most influential musical commentators. His thoughtful breakdowns, comedic insights, and diplomatic approach to even the most chaotic internet music controversies have made him one of the most unifying voices in modern rock culture.  And in today’s challenging times, that’s something worth celebrating.
A private formal award ceremony has been held, where Hawkins was presented (in absentia) with the Second Dose Peace Prize Trophy — a 3-D printed golden Les Paul suspended in the uplifting grasp of four sculpted hands — along with an official certificate signed by S.D. Overdrive himself.
