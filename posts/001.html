    <p>This wasn’t a coup... It was gravity. Nay, destiny<p>

  <p>
Momentum was building, but direction was missing, and hesitation was getting just a bit too comfortable. That ends now - I’m managing Second Dose...  and now they know.

  <p>
Second Dose didn't necessarily <i>ask</i> me to manage the band - I noticed no one was in the driver's seat and hopped on in. Yes, I'm already busy as President of FIRA, but this band has the riffs, the energy, and $12 for a website, so what could possibly go wrong?!

    If you’re wondering whether this will make things more organized — yes.<br>
    If you’re wondering whether it will make things quieter — you’ve misunderstood the assignment.

  <h3>Fan Mail (Received This Morning)</h3>

  <div style="border-left:4px solid #6df0ff; padding-left:1.25rem; margin:1.25rem 0;">

    <p>
      <strong>From:</strong> <em>RiffWizard69</em><br>
      <strong>Subject:</strong> Important Band Direction Question
    </p>

    <p>Dear S.D. Overdrive,</p>

    <p>
      I’ve been a fan of rock music since 1994 and I feel it’s important to ask:
    </p>

    <p>
      Will Second Dose be switching to a triple-neck guitar setup to better honor the spiritual
      lineage of classic arena rock?
    </p>

    <p>Also, will there be pyro indoors?</p>

    <p>
      Lastly, do you think the band should release <em>Rise Above</em> exclusively on glow-in-the-dark
      vinyl to maximize the vibrational frequency of the riffs?
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
      Todd<br>

  <h3>Response</h3>

  <p>Todd,</p>

  <p>Excellent questions. All of them.</p>

  <p>
    Triple-neck guitars are situational. You don’t deploy that kind of firepower unless the room
    deserves it. When it does, we’ll know.
  </p>

  <p>
    Indoor pyro is not a question of <em>if</em>, but insurance. We’ll cross that bridge loudly.
  </p>

  <p>
    As for glow-in-the-dark vinyl — sound is vibration, vibration is physics, and physics doesn’t lie.
    So yes. Conceptually, you’re thinking in the right direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keep your amps warm and your expectations high.<br>
    More updates soon. Probably sooner.
  </p>
