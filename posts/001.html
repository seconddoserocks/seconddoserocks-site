  <p>It’s official. I’m the manager of Second Dose.</p>

  <p>This was not put to a vote. There was no roundtable. No focus group. At some point, momentum required a steering wheel, and I picked it up.</p>

  <p>Management, for the record, does not mean spreadsheets and soft landings. It means direction. It means pacing. It means making decisions quickly enough that doubt doesn’t get a seat at the table.</p>

  <p>Second Dose doesn’t need permission. It needs movement. Releases. Noise. Pressure. Forward motion.</p>

  <p>If you’re wondering whether this will make things more organized — yes, absolutely. If you’re wondering whether it will make things quieter — you’ve misunderstood the assignment.</p>

  <p>The plan is simple: move fast, commit fully, and when in doubt, turn it up until the answer becomes obvious.</p>

  <p>Welcome to management.</p>
