        <strong>Management:</strong><br><br>

        Second Dose is managed by S.D. Overdrive, whose approach combines decisive
        planning, unapologetic confidence, and a firm belief that momentum improves
        with volume. Overdrive focuses on direction, pacing, and forward motion,
        favoring action over hesitation and clarity over caution.
        <br><br>
        When not attending to his responsibilities as President of FIRA, he remains
        closely involved with Second Dose, advising on strategy and releases while
        ensuring the band continues to operate at full throttle.
        <br><br>
        Expectations are simple: move fast, commit fully, and turn it up when in doubt.
