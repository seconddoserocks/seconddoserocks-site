        <strong>Management:</strong><br><br>

        Second Dose is managed by S.D. Overdrive, whose approach combines decisive
        planning, unapologetic confidence, and a firm belief that momentum improves
        with volume.  Overdrive focuses on direction, pacing, and forward motion,
        favoring action over hesitation and clarity over caution.
        <br><br>
        When not attending to his responsibilities as President of FIRA (Federation of International Rock Advancement), he will be clutching the
        promotional reins of Second Dose, while ensuring the band operates at full throttle. "WFO" as he puts it.
        <br><br>
        Expectations are simple: move fast, commit fully, and when in doubt... blow it up.
